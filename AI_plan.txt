It seems the path to intelligence that I've stumbled upon as lining up here is:
	1. consider simple modules that interconnect (individuals)
	2. consider a basic interconnection pattern that connects modules (individuals)
		2b. consider a decision-making process: consensus
	3. design the module such that it uses the decision making process to decide what to do
	4. meta-modules are composed of these groups that have decided upon input / output channels
	5. run the AI with the goal of optimizing the module design itself
		- minimize all resource usage
		- minimize number of modules and number of run cycle iterations (and other counts)
	6. run a constant core process that does this with the goal of categorizing existing run cycles and finding a use for them.
	7. when a cycle completes, add it to the largest core process that can continue the run-state in order to do something. (composting)
	This keeps all life alive.

Remember that there are infinite approaches to an AI.  This approach would line up well with the node-based approach you had
started around 2003 before you suddenly left Brown University due to suicide attempts.  Ben Goertzel has open sourced his AI and ideas can be merged.
