I'm trying to contact survivor support services for human/cyber trafficking.
I'm not sure that I am a survivor of human trafficking, but it would
be very helpful to talk to somebody who is experienced with talking
with such victims.  In need of therapy around this, it seems.  Perhaps really
just to be heard and have some connection to reality.
I found the Office for Victoms of Crime at ovc.ncjrs.gov .
Its simplest link is back to the National Human Trafficking Hotline,
888 373-7888, which I texted years ago but did not call.  This number is
likely intended for emergency use but could perhaps forward me somewhere
relevant.

	Scheduling requires everything to be in line.
	They will call back and say "we cannot schedule this because we don't have an authorization."
Medicaid says they will not authorize the CT scan unless a denial from my 'primary insurance' is available.

blacksburg group:
	1. cohousing community only for community
	2. practice group i heard of
	trainer for many years
	originally people came when they could, constantly changing
	but now interested in teaching folks deeply committed to leading a more compassionate life, using nvc as a way to focus doing that
	many folks now have been in housing nvc group up to 8 years, just keep learning together
	this is a newer group, still have been together more than a year
		deeply involved in making this more a part of their lives
	this is NOT a drop-in group
	CONSISTENCY of learning
	DEVELOP on what has been learned in the past
	GO DEEPER to develop
	patricia is committed to offering nvc to people
	age ranges ~20(college student) - ~67 (patricia), with james second oldest in fifties
	attendance limited to 10 or 12, sometimes there are only 4

	group involves TEACHING and GUIDANCE
	group provides empathy when needed but is not an empathy group, so don't dump everything at the last minute of a session
	"how can you let go of this enemy image? how can you let go of this frustration inside yourself?"
	we ask folks to investigate their jackals, and see what's going on
	facilitator tries to keep group on track, and not let one person's experience take things over

     I remember that Gwyn and Ben and I moved a lot of things from the truck, clearing the back wall for the firt time since it
     was loaded.  The storage unit is full of things now, but it is packed and there is little room to move around at all.
     It makes it really hard to access some of my project supplies, like the welder.
     I ended up getting a little burnt out processing where things could go, and ended the day with visiting Gwyn.

	           miscommunicated, because he arrived very close to 11 and stayed through 11.
	           I ended up asking him to leave when he did not leave at 11, rather rudely.
	           I really did not enjoy doing this; I felt so rude and mean and couldn't quite
	           handle it.  I ended up apologizing to Jeremy and hanging up on him because
	           having said this to the southern states tech was so rough for me.

- [ ] 2018-11-10 Sat
	- [X] 9a or 10a:  visit Christine, remember Gwyn coming in afternoon
	-> got christine's tire fixed, she ended up spending a lot of time begging and yelling towards her mother on my phone
	   I was able to help them communicate at first, but then I started freezing up, managed to contact Kate and Jim
	   eventually and Jim asked Christine to leave.  she started leaving but then called her mother again; I ended up
	   falling asleep and she was gone when I woke.
	   she had left me some dvds she feels she needs to watch, but she has no dvd player.  i began copying them to convert
	   them to a phone, but she returned and took them back when the process was barely started.  i haven't seen her since.
	   i hope she finds a dvd player because she feels the dvds will help her adjust her behavior so much.
	   i hope she is alive.  she's sleeping in her car and the temperature is dropping the lowest it has in the history
	   of the area according to jim.  she isn't eating much and when she is in somebody else's car she blasts the heat
	   as high as it goes and keeps it there.
	- [ ] Address some UPCOMING list items.  Add a logged number for how long the list is.
	- [ ] Gwyn visits afternoon through possibly Sunday in-and-out
	-> gwyn ended up taking me to her place.  i wanted to support her to have space from her abusive ex-husband, but it ended
	   up he wasn't visiting that week, so I spent time with her anyway because I didn't want to rudely ask for space myself.
	   it took me a day to really recover from the christine experience enough to do anything, which still feels really
	   unresolved

	-> The local electrosensitives introduced me to a new woman in the area named Christine who is in great need, medically
	   and psychologically, and is highly sensitive to the smells released by most buildings and won't enter them without
	   wearing a complex breathing device and experiencing increased suffering.
	   I spent the second half of this day with this woman, helping her find food (she hadn't eaten in a long time due
	   to sensitivities to the food) and listening to her, and making sure she had a place to sleep for that night that
	   helped her suffer less.  She is very new to not living indoors and appears terrified of her current life.
	   I feel very burnt out working to care for this woman in the midst of my memeory and awareness issues.  I asked
	   Gwyn for help but she was having a rough time herself.  I feel very irritated at Gwyn for not being able to help
	   Christine.
	   It's notable that Christine is also a name from my psychosis and my history, representing somebody I very much
	   want to help and have love for.
	   I stopped my nicotine and my work this day to help this person, and I very much want space and ease to resume
	   my work.  I've also discovered my money situation is much less than I thought it was.  Gwyn loaned me some money
	   and I wrote her a check twice to repay it, but both times I messed up with balancing my money and the checks
	   bounced.  Gwyn needs the money to pay her life expenses.
	   I plan to spend some time today Sat the 10th improving my money situation and to find the money to repay Gwyn
	   by the end of the day.  I'm creating the 'FINANCIAL' section in my organizer file above the 'calendar' section.
	   I also want to prepare for the day enough to pick up Christine at 9 or 10 AM and help her get her car fixed as
	   I promised.
	   I think I would feel a lot nicer in these situations if I had some friends who are also passionate about helping
	   people in this way.  I used to hang out with many of them, but I have not connected with anybody in the area
	   like this.  It was on my goal list to do just to help me feel nice, but I think once I start living it the need
	   is stronger.
