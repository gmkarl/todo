It's nice to know that other people have NVC.  It makes me happy and validates my inner opinions.

I guess it makes sense that a secret, very rough, group would inhibit me using NVC, because it would disempower them because
they are stuck with being secret.

It makes more sense regarding how things started for me, where I wanted to discuss these secret things openly, in a way that
allowed for understanding of some people being unable to talk, but did not value the wellbeing of the people who enforcing
the situation of silence.

Throughout CVF it was stressed the importance of including and valuing those who hold power or could cause problems.

Perhaps a view of a discussion circle with some people attending in secret situations could be revisited, with this
new study of NVC, CVF, etc.  One immediately enters the situation of a powerholder being able to cause an issue if
threatened.  Threatening the secret is an issue; how does one move forward?

This is quite a reasonable question for an NVC expert.  I understand many people have created peace in situations of very
serious conflict involving immediate death.  They likely have an answer.

- I came across the concept of referring to 'some of' people without referring to anybody in general.

	- Marshall has a story of listening to someone who could not talk, for five days of silence until they slowly opened up
	  Behavior like this could reveal secrets.
