- [X] I've added support for message commands to gr-osmosdr
- [ ] Add support for stream tags coming from sources
- [ ] Add support for stream tag commands?
  -> it's notable that UHD uses these only for transmitters and not receivers

- gnuradio uses tag streams / stream tags for data synchronous with samples
- gnuradio uses messages for asynchronous data

We'll want to make sure both of these are implemented for the interfaces we use.
This appears to be done for uhd/usrp

- there are also tagged stream bocks; tags are use to identify packet boundaries
  these appear to just be blocks that take special stream tags, but seem to have
  innate differences too
  -> there are blocks which convert between messages and tagged stream pdus

- gnuradio uses VOLK for vectorization

- !!! gr-osmosdr already appears to use some messages, but no tags

tags have:
- offset
- key, PMT
- value, PMT
- srcid, optional PMT identifying producer

int work(int noutput_items, gr_vector_const_void_start &input_items, gr_vector_void_start &output_items)
{
  // read tags with get_tags_in_range
  std::vector tags;
  const uint64_t nread = this->nitems_read(0); // number of items read on port 0
  const size_t ninput_items = noutput_items; // assuming this is a sync block
  
  // read all tags associated with port 0 for items in this work function
  this->get_tags_in_range(tags, 0, nread, nread + ninput_items);
  // or
  this->get_tags_in_window(tags, 0, 0, ninput_items); // i think
  // a fifth argument may be passed above to only get tags with a passed key


  // write tags with add_item_tag
  const size_t item_index = ? // which output item gets the tag?
  const uint64_t offset = this->nitems_writte(0) + item_index;
  pmt::pmt_t key = pmt::pmt_string_to_symbol("example_key");
  pmt::pmt_t value = pmt::pmt_string_to_symbol("example_value");

  // write a tag to output port 0 with given absolute item offset
  this->add_item_tag(0, offset, key, value);
}

DON'T SEND a lot of tags !! Send them only when they cannot be inferred from previous tags.
But DO e.g. send a new time tag if data is dropped.

UHD source tags:
  referenced as TIME_KEY, RATE_KEY, and FREQ_KEY in gnuradio/gr-uhd/lib/usrp_source_impl.cc
  These are all tuples, with key symbol, and value in parens
- "rx_time" (pair of uint64 full secs, double frac secs)
- "rx_rate" (double)
- "rx_freq" (double)

UHD sink tags:
  referenced as SOB_KEY, EOB_KEY, TIME_KEY, FREQ_KEY, and COMMAND_KEY in gnuradio/gr-uhd/lib/usrp_sink_impl.cc/h
- "tx_sob"
- "tx_eob"
- "tx_time"
- "tx_freq"
- "tx_command"

Metadata information has adopted UHD tags, using rx_rate and rx_time

Messages have their own set of ports, which are named by pmt strings rather than numbered.
Create message ports:
  message_port_register_in(name)
  message_port_register_out(name)
Publish a message:
  message_port_pub(name, msg)
Handle messages:
  set_msg_handler(name, boost::bind(&class::handler, this, _1));
  // handler is a void method taking a single pmt::pmt_t message
Connect message ports:
  topblock.msg_connect(srcblock, srcport, destblock, destport)
Manually post messages:
  use block._post(port, msg)
Format norms:
  For commands taking a single value, use pmt::cons(KEY, VALUE), where KEY is command and VALUE is param
  Otherwise, perhaps a pmt::dict((KEY1: VALUE1), (KEY2: VALUE2), ...)
  KEYs should be pmt::symbols i.e. strings.
  Please name things using these keys to help further use in the future, and not pass bare values.

UHD command keys:
  in gnuradio/gr-uhd/lib/usrp_block_impl.cc (affect both sink and source)
command keys, which may be sent many at once:
- "freq" (double)
    tunes to freq
- "lo_offset" (double)
    additional tuning parameter
- "gain" (double)
    sets gain
- "antenna" (string)
    sets antenna
- "rate" (double)
    sets samplerate
- "tune" (pair of double freq, double lo_offset)
    tunes, same as passing freq and lo_offset separately
- "bandwidth" (double)
    sets bandwidth
- "lo_freq" (double)
    sets rf freq directly, rather than freq + lo_offset
    appears to conflict with "freq","lo_offset", and "tune"
    also sets dsp freq policy to manual, even if "dsp_freq" is unset
- "dsp_freq"
    sets manual dsp_req
parameter keys:
- "mboard" (converted to long)
  if not provided all mboards are selected
- "time" (pair of uint64 full secs, and double frac secs)
  may be nil to clear command time, otherwise sets command time
- "chan" (converted to long)
  if not provided all chans are selected

  These take either pairs or dicts (both for all) as values.  tuples work too but appear deprecated.
