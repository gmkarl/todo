Backend: build supports for robust development environment based on gnuradio
Frontend: finish software to profile emitter and detect it, only working reasonably hard to detect it given profile

	ACCOMPLISHMENT!  I settled onto the profile/detection approach in a more laid-out way.
	I want to remember that if I get caught in the indecision of sensitivity vs complexity again, that I have chosen this solution.

	Next: pick an approach to profile.  Detection will just be simple

	SO MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS!
	I picked an approach to profile and detect.  Left to handle:
		- multiple sessions could have different PPM
		- wideband measurement / tuning
	I got basic profiler code working.  Just need to store to file and possibly consider PPM.
	I reached out on crypto lists and found a tscm list !!!! mirimir says he has done similar work !!

	ACCOMPLISHMENT! Run with device out of fridge vs hot gave the exact same measurements after 10 minutes.  Frozen device had only maybe 70% of the error though.
	ACCOMPLISHMENT! I left out in my plan how to measure the dB of the noise signal.  I remembered how laying in bed, and wrote it down.
	ACCOMPLISHMENT! I made a file class and stubbed out a good percentage of the file reading/writing.
		-> I feel uncertain I've picked an approach I will stick with, but at least it exists.
	ACCOMPLISHMENT! I integrated what little I had done of my plan to make general algorithm classes into my recent work.
		-> I'd like to integrate my other plans, but I don't remember them, and it's not the best use of time.
		   I just remember I'd planned another step very specifically, and I think it might integrate my current work with my previous work.

	ACCOMPLISHMENT!  I identified two bugs in my profiler, and wrote them down specifically.
	ACCOMPLISHMENT!  I came up with a detector approach that can also profile.

2018-10-21
	ACCOMPLISHMENT!	 I determined my bug was not a bug.  I'm not sure what I changed, but with more detail output the data is behaving as expected and the two methods of calculating it are agreeing.
	ACCOMPLISHMENT!  I learned a little about PPM.
		-> not sure how much time to invest in PPM .. not a problem on all radios ... but probably on multiple ones ... maybe add stats to rtl_test?
		-> i think plan was to ignore for now, and treat each recording as having unknown sample rate or somesuch
	ACCOMPLISHMENT!  I really flushed out what is needed for detector
	ACCOMPLISHMENT!  I fully described a plan outline for the new detector

	ACCOMPLISHMENT!  WE GOT OUT OF BED!
	ACCOMPLISHMENT!  I'll implement the algorithm choice of performing a convolution as a function or functor at namespace level.  It's great to make this algorithm choice, saves working time.  It's great to make some progress while laying in bed.
	ACCOMPLISHMENT!  I came up with a solution to measuring the significance of a whole wave by taking the product of the significances of each sample, to determine the likelihood they all occurred.
	ACCOMPLISHMENT!  I implemented the whole wave model accumulation class.  Should be reusable for future attempts, if this one doesn't work.
	ACCOMPLISHMENT!  I wrote the data retention portions of the detector class and began the core processing function.
	ACCOMPLISHMENT!  I moved my focus onto implementing the detector and added functionality to the wave model accumulation class to support this.  I gained awareness of the issue of sample start times.

2018-10-23
	ACCOMPLISHMENT!  I wrote maybe 75% of the detector implementation.
	ACCOMPLISHMENT!  I wrote an FFT convolution functor.
	ACCOMPLISHMENT!  I came up with a way to pursue replacing the body of the profiler with the convolution functor, and to consider using its approach for a faster, more accurate, convolution.

2018-10-27
	ACCOMPLISHMENT! I resolved some issues that were uncovered.  I fixed a bug where convolution was used instead of correlation that would have resulted in the approach failing.
	ACCOMPLISHMENT! I determined a way to line up the differing frequencies more precisely.
	ACCOMPLISHMENT! I finished writing an implementation of the detector!  Partway through fixing compilation errors.
2018-10-30
	ACCOMPLISHMENT! I resolved all the compilation errors with the new detector.
	ACCOMPLISHMENT! I fixed all the bugs with correlating the period properly.
	
FRONTEND: - [X] pick an approach to profiling (perhaps FFT?) (note it is LOUDER THAN ALL BACKGROUND NOISE)
BACKEND: - [ ] do a task from gr-osmosdr/TASKS.txt
FRONTEND: - [ ] store profile to file (and make profiling binary?)
FRONTEND: - [ ] plan precisely how to handle PPM
FRONTEND: - [ ] implement detector based on integrating exact known period (can detect when accuracy may be exhausted by phase drift?)
FRONTEND: - [ ] when working, close up backend here for now.  it was only if frontend was a dead end.
