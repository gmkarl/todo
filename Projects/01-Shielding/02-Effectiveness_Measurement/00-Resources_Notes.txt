RTL-SDR articles may help me calculate measurement properly.

	Adam Alicajic has videos showing how to measure frequency response with noise gens
[ ] blog.dxers.info
	Tim Havens builds a mobile tool for measuring relative noise floors
	Is happy for others to get in touch with him
	a commenter mentioned airspies would work better than rtl-sdrs for this
		makes since if they have higher samplerate.  tuning bandwidth could be
		adjusted for with converters if it differs
[ ] http://www.arrl.org/power-line-noise-mitigation-handbook-for-naval-and-other-receiving-sites
	bible from navy postgraduate school regarding power line noise & possibly noise floors.  should consider getting the whole website.
[ ] https://www.rowetel.com/?p=5867
	Rowetel creates a live real-time measurement of the "noise figure" of an arbitrary SDR setup, using a calibrated signal generator.
	This could help both with live updated reports of noise, and with working with
	a calibrated sinusoidal source.
	A commenter mentions https://www.rowetel.com/p?=5057 as well
[ ] review amplificaion hardware.  note there is an 'lna4all' that is high
	qual amplifier.  is helpful to use cables designed for frequency,
	short runs

	rtl-sdr.com just links to hans's site
[X] https://www.rtl-sdr.com/characterizing-rf-filters-noise-source-rtl-sdr-dongle
	Links to Adam's vidoes
	Mentions the noise source may be built with diode circuit,
	or parts may be purchased and combined with upconverter
[X] more articles starting with 'measuring-*' in rtl-sdr.com could be useful
[X] measuring-frequency-eviation-fm-transmitter-rtl-sdr
	This is difficult to understand but appears to be about measuring the bandwidth
	used by an fm transmitter to carry its signal.
[X] https://www.rtl-sdr.com/measuring-power-line-noise-neighbourhood-rtl-sdr-driveby-system
	This is worth grokking all the comments and links.
	Tim states that rtl-sdr's don't measure the noise floor reliably until 5 min of
	warmup time.
	Uses Odroid XU3 which has power for 5 simultaneous dongles.
	His writings are on blog.dxers.info
[X] measuring-the-input-impedance-of-the-rtl28382u-direct-sampling-input-pins
	some references regarding actually using the direct sampling pins of rtl-sdr to
	record <14MHz
